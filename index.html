            Student EDA is a full immersion full-stack javascript bootcamp. Not
            only focusing on code but on the soft skills required to be a
            functional member of a productive team. With over 800 hours of
            coding in a pairs and within a team on many different projects, i
            have developed invaluable skills that will allow me to enter any
            team with ease and confidence. On any given day I would be pair
            coding with up to two different partners (driver navigator style)
            and interacting within a group dynamic. But have also had the time
            to develop my skills as a solo coder working on my own personal
            projects and learning endeavours. For more information on my
            technical/practical abilities please take a look at my letter of
            graduation which outlines all skills achieved.

              <span style="font-weight: 900">Cafe 93</span> Managing Director (2012 - 2017) -
              Challenging enough, I have been operating a busy cafe business during the year 2012 to 2017. Without owning a business before and bearing a reasonable amount of loan, I had to push my limit and stretch all my skills i.e. management skill gained through my previous experience as a cafe manager; multi-tasking ability as I had to align the workflow of front-of-house, kitchen and catering orders dispatch; relationship building with customers and suppliers by humbly hearing their feedback as there would be no business to run without them. All business owners will agree that employee performance is one of the most important factors of a successful business, knowing this I had strengthened team leading and staff management techniques by caring, mentoring and motivating all staff members. Even with all the skills, I still won't be successful if I didn't have the absolute can-do attitude and willingness to learn. In the early stage, with only 5-6 hours of sleep I had to get up at 3:00AM every morning to start preparing in the Cafe and would usually finish at 5:30PM. There were so much involved in operating a business even if it's small. Not only day to day tasks of which already a lot for me to learn but I have also developed my skill of planning and marketing for the business to sustain and grow. This valuable experience made all my other previous jobs seem like child play but most importantly I came out stronger and ready to tackle all challenges lie ahead.
